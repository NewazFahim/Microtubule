# Mirotubules Project ar a glance.
Precise calculation of curvature in HS-AFM images (or videos) was achieved through a semi-automated process. Initially, raw images were imported into Adobe Illustrator, where paths were manually traced over the structures. The number of anchor points on each path was increased, and their coordinates were subsequently extracted into a text file. To accomplish these tasks, two separate JavaScript scripts were developed and integrated with Adobe Illustrator, utilizing its scripting API to manipulate Illustrator functions. The text file containing the coordinates was then processed by a Python script, which applied a least squares optimization algorithm to fit circles to the extracted points. The radii of these fitted circles were computed, facilitating the determination of curvature for each path
# Enhancing the Anchor points
The first script utilizes Adobe Illustrator's scripting API to automate the precise subdivision of path segments within vector graphics, streamlining the process of detailed design modifications. Initially, the script checks the version of Adobe Illustrator to ensure compatibility, adjusting its behavior accordingly. It then identifies and extracts path items from the user's selection. Based on a user-defined parameter, the script calculates the positions for new anchor points along the selected segments, which are then inserted to divide the segments into smaller, evenly spaced sections. This automation significantly reduces the manual effort typically required for such tasks, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of segment manipulation in vector graphic design workflows. The script's ability to consistently and accurately divide path segments makes it a valuable tool for designers working on complex illustrations, where precision is paramount.
# Extracting the Co-ordinates of Anchor points:
The second JavaScript script is for Adobe Illustrator and helps to automatically collect and save the positions of path segments from vector graphics. It uses an IIFE (a special kind of function that runs immediately) to keep it separate from other scripts. The main function, called CreateSegPosition, goes through all the path items in the active Illustrator document.It gathers the coordinates (positions) of the anchor points (key points that make up the paths) and stores this information in an array. After collecting the data, the script saves it to a text file chosen by the user. The script uses prototype-based methods, which are a way to efficiently read, store, and write the anchor point positions.This script makes it easier to extract path data automatically, so you don’t have to do it manually, reducing mistakes. Its structure and use of local variables also help to make it reliable and easy to use for documenting and analyzing vector graphic designs in Illustrator.
# Calculating the Curvatures:  
This Python script facilitates the analysis of geometric properties of paths extracted from an Adobe Illustrator document by processing anchor point data stored in a text file. The script begins by loading the data from the text file and parsing it into a structured format using pandas and defaultdict. Each path's anchor points are extracted, and the script employs a least squares optimization algorithm to fit circles to these points. The optimization minimizes the algebraic distance between the data points and the mean circle centered at (x_c, y_c) defined by the equation:
# f_2 (c)=R_i-|R|
where R_i=√(〖(x-x_c)〗^2-〖(y-y_c)〗^2 ) represents the distance from each point (x,y) to the circle center, and |R| is the mean distance of all points to the center. The fitted circles' radii are calculated, enabling the determination of curvature for each path. The results are then visualized through histograms of the radii and curvatures, as well as a graphical representation of the paths overlaid with their corresponding fitted circles. This approach provides a quantitative and visual assessment of the curvature characteristics of the paths, aiding in the geometric analysis of vector graphics within Illustrator
