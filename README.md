# Microtubule Curvature Analysis at a Glance.
Precise curvature calculations for objects in HS-AFM images (or videos) were achieved through a semi-automated process. Raw images were first imported into Adobe Illustrator, where paths were manually traced over the structures. The number of anchor points on each path was then increased, and their coordinates were extracted into a text file. These tasks were accomplished using two JavaScript scripts developed for Adobe Illustrator's scripting API to automate path manipulation. The resulting coordinate text file was subsequently processed by a Python script that applied a least-squares optimization algorithm to fit circles to the points, from which radii—and thus curvatures—were computed for each path.
# Enhancing the Anchor points
The first script (Divide(length).js) utilizes Adobe Illustrator's scripting API to automate the precise subdivision of path segments within vector graphics, streamlining the process of detailed design modifications. Initially, the script checks the version of Adobe Illustrator to ensure compatibility and adjusts its behavior accordingly. It then identifies and extracts path items from the user's selection. Based on a user-defined parameter, the script calculates the positions for new anchor points along the selected segments, which are then inserted to divide the segments into smaller, evenly spaced sections. This automation significantly reduces the manual effort typically required for such tasks, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of segment manipulation in vector graphic design workflows. The script's ability to consistently and accurately divide path segments makes it a valuable tool for designers working on complex illustrations, where precision is paramount.
# Extracting the Co-ordinates of Anchor points:
The second JavaScript script(Segment position.js) for Adobe Illustrator automatically collects and saves the positions of path segments from vector graphics. It uses an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to keep its scope separate from other scripts. The main function, CreateSegPosition, iterates over all path items in the active Illustrator document and gathers the coordinates of anchor points (the key points that define each path), storing this information in an array. After collecting the data, the script saves it to a text file specified by the user. By using prototype-based methods to efficiently read, store, and write anchor point positions, the script streamlines the extraction of path data, reducing manual work and minimizing errors. Its structure and use of local variables make it reliable and easy to use for documenting and analyzing vector graphic designs in Illustrator.
# Calculating the Curvatures:  
This Python script facilitates the analysis of geometric properties of paths extracted from an Adobe Illustrator document by processing anchor point data stored in a text file. The script begins by loading the data from the text file and parsing it into a structured format using pandas and defaultdict. Each path's anchor points are extracted, and the script employs a least-squares optimization algorithm to fit circles to these points. The optimization minimizes the algebraic distance between the data points and the mean circle centered at (x_c,y_c), defined by the equation:
F_2(c)=R_i−∣R∣
where R_i=√ (|x−x_c|)^2+(|y−y_c|)^2
represents the distance from each point (x,y) to the circle center, and ∣R∣ is the mean distance of all points to the center. The radii of the fitted circles are calculated, enabling the determination of curvature for each path. The results are visualized through histograms of the radii and curvatures, as well as a graphical representation of the paths overlaid with their corresponding fitted circles. This approach provides a quantitative and visual assessment of the curvature characteristics of the paths, aiding in the geometric analysis of vector graphics in Illustrator.
